Interactive Study Agent Prototype Structure

This architecture is adapted from the robust agent model to provide personalized study planning, content generation, and testing tools.

1. Core Agent (Interactive Entry Point)

Agent Name: interactive_study_agent
Function: The central orchestrator. It receives the user's initial goal (e.g., "Study for the Civil War exam," "Learn about Fourier Transforms") and delegates tasks to the appropriate loop agents and specialized tools.

2. Planning and Research Loop

Loop Agent Name: robust_learning_planner (Loop Agent)
Function: Ensures a comprehensive, validated study plan is generated before content creation begins. It iterates until the plan is approved by the internal validation checker.

Component Name

Type

Description

learning_planner_agent

Agent

Generates the initial study outline, prioritizing topics, allocating time, and identifying key concepts based on the user's input.

plan_validation_checker

Checker Tool

Reviews the generated outline against criteria like completeness, topic relevance, and balance. It can prompt the learning_planner_agent to refine the plan.

Google Search

Tool

Used initially to retrieve external information (e.g., historical timelines, official syllabus details, basic definitions) to inform the plan.

3. Content Generation and Verification Loop

Loop Agent Name: robust_explanation_generator (Loop Agent)
Function: Focuses on generating high-quality, accurate, and digestible explanations for individual concepts, self-correcting for accuracy.

Component Name

Type

Description

concept_explainer_agent

Agent

Takes a topic from the learning_planner and generates a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation, including examples and analogies.

accuracy_validation_checker

Checker Tool

Verifies the factual accuracy, tone, and depth of the generated explanation. It prompts the concept_explainer_agent to refine or elaborate if the content is too brief or factually weak.

4. Specialized Agents and Tools

These components provide additional study utility based on the generated content.

Component Name

Type

Description

quiz_generator_agent

Agent

Transforms the core explanatory content into various test formats (multiple choice, true/false, short answer questions).

flashcard_formatter_agent

Agent

Extracts key definitions, dates, formulas, or concepts and formats them specifically for review (e.g., "Front: Term

document_analyzer_tool

Tool

Allows the agent to ingest and analyze specific, private documents (like a syllabus or PDF textbook chapter) provided by the user for grounding the content.

save_study_notes_to_file

Tool

Saves the final plan, notes, quizzes, or flashcard deck to a file for easy download or archival.
